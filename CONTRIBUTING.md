# Contributing Guidelines

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process. 
We are happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to improve/add new scripts to this project. Thank you for helping out and remember,

Below you will find the process used to review and merge your pull request.
## Step 1 : Find an issue
- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Comment on the issue you want to work on and the maintainers will assign you the issue.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue. 

## Step 2 : Project Conventions
- All the screen that you make must be inside screens folder and filename should be of the pattern <filename>_screen.dart
- All the explicit widget created must go inside widgets folder and filename should be of the pattern <filename>_widget.dart
- All the styles that are implement would go into separate file NOT inline.
